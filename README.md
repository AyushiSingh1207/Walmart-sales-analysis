# Walmart Sales Analysis: SQL & Python Project

Walmart Sales Analysis: SQL & Python Project
Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end data analysis solution focused on extracting valuable business insights from Walmart's sales data. It integrates SQL for querying, Python for data processing, and structured problem-solving techniques to explore key business trends. This project is perfect for data analysts looking to enhance their skills in data manipulation, SQL querying, and data pipeline development.

Project Workflow
1. Environment Setup
Tools Used: Python, MySQL/PostgreSQL, VS Code
Objective: Create a structured workspace and organize project files efficiently for seamless data processing.
2. Kaggle API Integration
Dataset Retrieval: Fetch Walmart sales data using the Kaggle API.
Setup Instructions:
Download the kaggle.json API key from Kaggle.
Store it in the .kaggle folder.
Use kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-path> to access data.
3. Data Collection & Storage
Source: Walmart Sales dataset from Kaggle.
Download Method: Using the Kaggle API or manual download.
Storage Structure: Save all raw data files in the data/ directory.
4. Installing Required Libraries
Install necessary dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python psycopg2
Load the dataset into Pandas for initial exploration.
5. Data Exploration
Goal: Gain insights into column distributions, missing values, and data types.
Methods:
Use .info(), .describe(), and .head() to examine the dataset.
6. Data Cleaning
Handling Duplicates: Remove duplicate entries.
Missing Values: Fill or drop missing records based on significance.
Fixing Data Types: Convert columns (e.g., dates to datetime, prices to float).
Currency & Formatting: Process currency values for consistency.
7. Feature Engineering
New Columns:
Compute total_amount for each transaction as unit_price × quantity.
Purpose:
These additional features improve SQL-based aggregations and business insights.
8. Database Integration
MySQL/PostgreSQL Setup:
Use SQLAlchemy for connecting Python with SQL databases.
Automate table creation and data insertion.
Verification: Run queries to ensure data integrity.
9. Business Analytics with SQL
Solve key business problems using SQL queries, including:
Sales trends by branch and category.
Customer preferences (ratings, payment methods, peak hours).
Profit analysis for different product categories.
Branch-wise performance metrics.
10. Documentation & Deployment
Project Documentation: Maintain well-structured Markdown/Jupyter Notebooks.
Version Control:
Publish project files on GitHub, including:
README.md
SQL scripts
Python notebooks
Data processing scripts
